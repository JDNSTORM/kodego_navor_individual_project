    <string name="introduction">Hi! My name is James Dave Navor and this is an app the I developed while learning how to develop a mobile application.
\nThis app is called My Digital Profile which is inspired by PHP which was originally known as \'Personal Home Page\'.
This is a project I\'ve been working on since I\'ve studied Web Development and have completed it on Mobile App Development.
\nI developed this app with the idea of how I could showcase my skills while considering the use case for other users too.
This app will most likely be used by job-seekers who want to show their profile in the way I formatted it.
\nThis app is still underdeveloped and I\'m still learning more things to further enhance my skills.
This will not be the final output but it will be further enhanced in the future.
\nIf you are also a developer and is interested in looking into my code, or if you are interested into looking into my profile inside this app,
You can view it through the buttons below.</string>
